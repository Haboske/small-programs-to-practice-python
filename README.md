# small programs to practice python

Hi ! You are looking to a repository that contains only some small projects just to practice python so my school can check at my work.

You can use them all to have a try. But first you have to ensure that python >3.7 is installed on your computer but also the colorama package.

Attention, colorama doesn't work with Windows CMD or PowerShell. You have to use GitBash.
No problems for Mac and Linux user here !

If you want to make a feedback, I'm all open for it.
Don't hesitate to write me on bdelaitre@gaming.tech

Enjoy
